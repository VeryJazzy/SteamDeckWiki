        <h2 class="page-title">Hardware</h2>
        <p>The Steam Deck includes a custom accelerated processing unit (APU) built by AMD based on their Zen 2 and RDNA
            2 architectures, named Aerith, after the Final Fantasy VII character Aerith Gainsborough. The CPU runs a
            four-core/eight-thread unit and the GPU runs on eight compute units with a total estimated performance of
            1.6 TFLOPS. Both the CPU and GPU use variable timing frequencies, with the CPU running between 2.4 and 3.5
            GHz and the GPU between 1.0 and 1.6 GHz based on current processor needs. Valve stated that the CPU
            has comparable performance to Ryzen 3000 desktop computer processors and the GPU performance to the Radeon
            RX 6000 series. The Deck includes 16 GB of LPDDR5 RAM in a quad-channel configuration, with a total
            bandwidth of 88 GB/s.

        <h4>Controls</h4>

            The Deck's main unit is designed for handheld use. It includes a 7-inch (180 mm) touchscreen LCD display
            with a 1280x800 pixel resolution with a fixed 60 Hz refresh rate; games are configured to use vertical
            synchronization where possible. The unit's input set features two thumbsticks, a directional pad, ABXY
            buttons, two shoulder buttons on each side of the unit, four additional buttons on the rear of the unit, as
            well as two trackpads under each thumbstick. The thumbsticks and trackpads use capacitive sensing,
            and the unit further includes a gyroscope to allow for more specialized controls on the handheld mode.
            The unit also includes haptic feedback.

        <h4>Hardware Shipped</h4>
        <p>The unit shipped in three models based on internal storage options. The base model includes a 64 GB eMMC
            internal storage unit, running over PCI Express 2.0 x1. A mid-tier model includes 256 GB of storage through
            an NVMe SSD device, while the high-end unit includes a 512 GB NVMe SSD storage unit, with the latter two
            both shipping with drives that run PCI Express 3.0 x4. All 3 SKUs utilize the same M.2 2230 interface for
            internal storage. Valve stated that the built-in storage is not meant to be replaceable by end-users,
            though can be replaced as necessary for repair. Additional storage space is available through a microSD
            card slot, which also supports microSDXC and microSDHC formats.

        <p>The Deck supports Bluetooth connectivity for input devices, including common game controllers, and includes
            integrated WiFi network support to meet IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac standards, stereo sound out via a
            digital signal processor, an integrated microphone and a headphone jack, a 40 watt-hour battery, which
            Valve estimates that for "lighter use cases like game streaming, smaller 2D games, or web browsing" can last
            between seven and eight hours. Valve also estimated that by keeping frame rates to around 30 frames per
            second (FPS) more intensive games such as Portal 2 could be played for five to six hours. The system's
            software includes an optional FPS limiter that balance a game's performance to optimize battery life.
        </p>
        <p>At release, Steam Decks were only manufactured in a black casing to reduce the complexity of production,
            though Valve stated that they have considered introducing other case colors or themes in the future.
            Valve partnered with iFixit to provide replacement parts for users.
        </p>

        <h4>Dock</h4>
        <p>A dock unit was released on October 6, 2022. The dock unit can be connected to an external power
            source to power the Deck, and to an external monitor via either HDMI or DisplayPort protocols to route
            output from the Deck to that monitor. Though limited by the processor speed, the display output from the
            Deck via the dock can reach as high as 8k resolution at 60 Hz or 4k resolution at 120 Hz; this
            resolution boost can also be achieved by attaching the Deck directly through a USB to HDMI adapter without
            the use of the docking station. There is no other change in performance of the Steam Deck whether docked
            or when used in portable mode. The dock also supports Ethernet network connectivity and support for USB
            connections for controllers or other input devices. The Deck can also work with any third-party docking
            station that supports similar types of interfacing for portable devices. External GPUs are not
            officially supported, although testing via the M2 slot has demonstrated that eGPUs are capable of
            running when connected to the Deck.
        </p>
        <p>As Valve considered options for bringing a handheld device to market, they set a priority that the device
            had to be able to play nearly the entirety of the Steam game library, and rejected possible hardware that
            moved away from the standard x86-based processing structure that would have been easier to implement in
            handheld form but would have limited what games would be available. Only through recent discussions with AMD
            and their current product lines was Valve able to identify a technical approach that would meet the goal of
            a handheld device capable of playing all Steam games without overtaxing the processor unit. The
            developers considered the Steam Deck to be future-proof. While the specifications are modest compared to
            high-end gaming computers, they felt that the performance was at a good place that would be acceptable for
            many years, while still looking at newer software improvements, such as the addition of AMD's FidelityFX
            Super Resolution (FSR). Though they do not have any current designs for a successor, Valve stated that
            there would likely be future iterations of the hardware in years to come, but the company expects the timing
            of releases to depend on the current state of processor technology and handheld device limitations rather
            than a regular upgrade cycle.

        <h4>Previous attempts</h4>
        <p>Valve's first foray into hardware was with the Steam Machine, a computer specification based on the
            Linux-derived SteamOS that could be adopted by any computer manufacturer to make systems optimized for
            running Steam and games from it. Introduced in 2015, the platform did not sell well and Valve quietly pulled
            back on it by April 2018, but stated they remained committed to providing some type of open-hardware
            platform. Steam Deck designer Scott Dalton said "there was always kind of this classic chicken and egg
            problem with the Steam Machine", as it required the adoption of Linux by both gamers and game developers to
            reach a critical interest in the machines to draw manufacturers in making them. The lack of Linux game
            availability during the lifetime of Steam Machines led Valve to invest development into Proton, a
            Linux-based compatibility layer to allow most Windowsâ€“based applications and games to be run on Linux
            without modification.

        <p>Other factors from the Steam Machine line worked their way into the conception of the Steam Deck. The Steam
            Controller was developed by Valve as part of the Steam Machine line. Some of the early prototypes of the
            controller included a small LCD screen within the middle of the controller which could be programmed as a
            second screen alongside the game that the user was playing. One idea from this prototype was to include the
            Steam Link, a hardware device capable of streaming game content from a computer running Steam to a different
            monitor, here routing that output to the small LCD on the controller. This was later considered by Valve a
            very early concept behind the Steam Deck. Further, their experience with trying to convince other
            manufacturers to produce Steam Machines led Valve to realize that it was better to develop all their
            hardware internally. Dalton said, "More and more it just became kind of clear, the more of this we are doing
            internally, the more we can kind of make a complete package."
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Announcement</h4>
        <p>Rumors that Valve was working on a portable gaming unit had emerged in May 2021, based on updates made
            within the Steam code pointing towards a new "SteamPal" device, and comments made by Gabe Newell related to
            Valve developing games for consoles. Ars Technica had been able to confirm that new hardware was in
            development at Valve.
        </p>


        <p>Valve revealed the Steam Deck on July 15, 2021. The Deck, existing in three different models based on
            internal storage options, was shipped starting in February 2022 in North America and Europe, with other
            regions to follow throughout the year. However, due to its popularity, some pre-order purchasers were
            informed that later shipments of the 64 GB model and 256 GB NVMe models would be in Q2 2022 and the 512 GB
            NVMe model by Q3 2022. Valve informed pre-purchasers in November 2021 that due to the ongoing global chip
            shortage, the device would fail to ship by December and instead would ship in February 2022, retaining the
            same order for delivery based on pre-order placement.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Valves approach</h4>
        <p>Valve's CEO, Gabe Newell, said of the Steam Deck's approach, "As a gamer, this is a product I've always
            wanted. And as a game developer, it's the mobile device I've always wanted for our partners. According
            to Newell, they wanted to be "very aggressive" on the release and pricing strategy as they considered the
            mobile market as their primary competitor for the Deck. However, their focus was on the unit's performance;
            Newell stated, "But the first thing was the performance and the experience, [that] was the biggest and most
            fundamental constraint that was driving this."Newell recognized that the base pricing was somewhat lower
            than expected and "painful", but necessary to meet the expectation of gamers that would want the Deck.
            Newell continued that he believed this was a new product category of personal computer hardware that Valve
            and other computer manufacturers would continue to participate in if the Steam Deck proved successful, and
            thus it was necessary to keep the unit's price point reasonable to demonstrate viability. The openness of
            the system was also a key feature according to Newell, as that is a defining "superpower" of the personal
            computer space over typical console systems. Newell did not want to have any limitations on what the end
            user could do with the hardware, such as installing alternate non-Steam software on it.
        </p>
        <p>Pre-orders for the Steam Deck were opened a day after its announcement. Pre-orders were limited to those
            with Steam accounts opened before June 2021, to prevent resellers from depleting stock and making the device
            more difficult to purchase. First-day pre-order reservations through the Steam storefront briefly crashed
            the servers due to the demand. By September 2021, development kits for the Steam Deck were shipping to
            developers. The device was released on February 25, 2022.
        </p>

        <h4>Release in other regions</h4>
        <p>For the planned release in Asian regions, Valve worked with Komodo to help with local production,
            localization, and distribution support.

        <p>By June 2022, Valve stated they were able to double the number Steam Decks shipping out each week, helping
            to meet the initial reservations, and by August 2022, Valve's production was outpacing expectations,
            allowing them to send out Steam Decks to consumers that were originally anticipated to ship in the final
            quarter of the year. Valve was able to fulfill all reservations by October 2022, opening the Steam Deck
            to purchase without reservation, though Valve tentatively will return to a reservation system should demand
            be too high.

                The Steam Deck is a handheld gaming computer developed by Valve Corporation. Released on February 25,
                2022,
                the Steam Deck can be played as a handheld or connected to a monitor in the same manner as the Nintendo
                Switch.
                <br><br>
                It is an x86-64-v3 device with integrated gaming inputs designed to play the full Steam library,
                including
                Windows PC games via the Linux-based Proton compatibility layer. The system is an open platform,
                allowing users to
                install other compatible games on the device or other operating systems.
                <br><br>
                Once you've logged into Steam Deck, your entire Steam Library shows up, just like any other PC. You'll
                also see the compatibility rating of each game, indicating the kind of experience you can expect when
                playing. You can dynamically filter any view in your library by compatibility rating if you're looking
                for specific sorts of experiences.

                Steam is a video game digital distribution service and storefront by Valve. It was launched as a
                software client in September 2003 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, and
                expanded to distributing and offering third-party game publishers' titles in late 2005. Steam offers
                various features, like digital rights management (DRM), game server matchmaking, anti-cheat measures,
                social networking and game streaming services. It provides the user with automatic game updating, saved
                game cloud synchronization, and community features such as friends messaging, in-game chat and a
                community market.

                Valve released a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks in 2008,
                which developers can use to integrate Steam's functions into their products, including in-game
                achievements, microtransactions, and user-created content support. Initially developed for Microsoft
                Windows operating systems, Steam was released for macOS in 2010 and Linux in 2012. Mobile apps to access
                online Steam features were first released for iOS and Android in 2012. The platform also offers other
                digital content and Valve gaming hardware, including productivity software, game soundtracks, videos and
                VR headset Valve Index.
                <br><br>
                The service is the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming, estimated around 75% of the
                market share in 2013 according to IHS Screen Digest.[2] By 2017, users purchasing games through Steam
                totaled approximately US$4.3 billion, representing at least 18% of global PC game sales according to
                Steam Spy.[3] By 2021, the service had over 34,000 games with over 132 million monthly active users.[4]
                The success of Steam has led to the development of the Steam Machine line of gaming PCs in 2015, which
                includes the SteamOS operating system and Steam Controller, Steam Link devices for local game streaming,
                and the handheld Steam Deck tailored for running Steam games in 2022.
